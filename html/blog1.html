            <h2><u>Planet Earth</u></h2>
            <p>
                Our home, is the third planet from the sun. While scientists continue to hunt for clues of life beyond Earth, our home planet remains the only place in the universe where we've ever identified life.

                Earth is the fifth-largest planet in the solar system. It's smaller than the four gas giants — Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — but larger than the three other rocky planets, Mercury, Mars and Venus.

                Earth has a diameter of roughly 8,000 miles (13,000 kilometers) and is round because gravity pulls matter into a ball. But our home planet isn't perfectly round, rather, Earth is really an "oblate spheroid," because its spin causes it to be squashed at its poles and swollen at the equator.

                Water covers roughly 71 percent of Earth's surface, with most of that water located in our planet's oceans, and about a fifth of Earth's atmosphere consists of oxygen, produced by plants. While scientists have been studying our planet for centuries, much has been learned in recent decades by studying Earth from space using satellite technology.
