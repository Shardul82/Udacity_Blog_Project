                <strong><i><u>Football, or Association Football,</u></i></strong> is unequivocally the most popular
                sport on the planet. The sport has an estimated fanbase of three and a half to four billion people
                globally (roughly half the human population) and is the most popular sport in most countries. The game’s
                origins go back a couple of thousand years, but the modern sport that is played today began in England,
                where the first set of rules was decided upon in 1863. Since then, the sport has undergone multiple
                stages of development, expansion, and commercialization and is now played by approximately 250 million
                people around the world.

                Today, the sport consists of multiple leagues around the world. Most countries have their own internal
                league system through which teams in that country compete against each other. There are also continental
                tournaments in which the best teams in various countries compete against each other. football is played
                internationally as well. The best players from each country come together to represent their national
                team in various competitions, including the World Cup, the most popular single-sport sporting event in
                the world. International games and tournaments often occur during the summer when most leagues have
                finished or during weeks in the season when teams don’t have matches.

                Professional football is organized and governed by FIFA, which stands for the French translation of the
                International Federation of Association Football. FIFA governs all 211 national football associations
                and, in turn, oversees all of the club teams within each nation’s football association. These national
                associations then make up the six football confederations, the continental governing bodies of FIFA. The
                six confederations are the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the Confederation of African Football
                (AFC), the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), the
                South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA),
                and the Oceania Football Association (OFC)
